Step 1: Data Exploration & Understanding

What we did?

- Set up the project environment in Google Colab with an A100 GPU (40GB VRAM) and 80GB RAM, saving all results to Google Drive at /content/drive/MyDrive/Extro_Intro. Appropriate folders were created for data, results, and figures.
- Loaded the training and test datasets into pandas DataFrames.
- Inspected the data types, missing values, and basic statistics for all features.
- Generated and saved visualizations for the distributions of all numeric features and the class distribution.

What we found?

- The dataset contains 18,524 training samples and 6,176 test samples.
- Several features have missing values, with the highest being 'Stage_fear' (1,893 missing in train).
- The target variable 'Personality' is imbalanced: Extrovert is the majority class.
- Numeric features have varying distributions, with some being right-skewed (e.g., Time_spent_Alone).

The results summarized:

| Feature                   | Missing Values (train) |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Time_spent_Alone          | 1,190                  |
| Stage_fear                | 1,893                  |
| Social_event_attendance   | 1,180                  |
| Going_outside             | 1,466                  |

| Friends_circle_size       | 1,054                  |
| Post_frequency            | 1,264                  |
| id, Personality           | 0                      |

- Class distribution:
  - Extrovert: 13,699
  - Introvert: 4,825

Interpretation:

- The dataset is imbalanced, which may affect model performance and will require special handling.
- Missing values are present in several features and must be addressed before modeling.
- The features show diverse distributions, suggesting the need for careful preprocessing and possibly feature engineering.
- The project environment and folder structure are set up to ensure reproducibility and data safety. 

Step 2: Exploring Relationships Between Features and Target

What we did?

- Calculated groupby statistics (means) for numeric features by Personality.
- Generated boxplots for numeric features by Personality.
- Created bar plots for categorical features by Personality.
- Produced a correlation heatmap for numeric features.
- Saved all outputs to Google Drive as per the project setup.

What we found?

- Extroverts post much more frequently than introverts.
- Most extroverts do not have stage fear, while most introverts do.
- Introverts spend significantly more time alone than extroverts.
- Extroverts have larger friend circles; introverts have smaller ones.
- Extroverts attend more social events and go outside more often than introverts.
- Most extroverts do not feel drained after socializing, while most introverts do.
- Social activity features are positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with time spent alone.

The results summarized:

| Feature                  | Extrovert (mean/majority) | Introvert (mean/majority) | Key Difference                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Post_frequency           | High                      | Low                       | Extroverts post more          |
| Stage_fear               | No                        | Yes                       | Introverts have more stage fear|
| Time_spent_Alone         | Low                       | High                      | Introverts spend more time alone|
| Friends_circle_size      | Large                     | Small                     | Extroverts have more friends  |
| Social_event_attendance  | High                      | Low                       | Extroverts attend more events |
| Going_outside            | High                      | Low                       | Extroverts go outside more    |
| Drained_after_socializing| No                        | Yes                       | Introverts feel more drained  |

- Correlation Heatmap: Social activity features are positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with time spent alone.

Interpretation:

- The features show clear, interpretable differences between introverts and extroverts, supporting their predictive value for classification.
- Social activity, friend circle size, and time spent alone are especially strong distinguishing factors.
- The strong correlations among social features suggest possible redundancy, which may be addressed in feature selection or engineering.
- The categorical features (stage fear, drained after socializing) align well with personality types and may be highly informative.
- These insights will guide feature engineering, model selection, and preprocessing in the next steps. 

Step 3: Outlier and Anomaly Detection

What we did?

- Generated boxplots for all numeric features to visually inspect for outliers.
- Used the z-score method (|z| > 3) to detect statistical outliers in each numeric feature.
- Saved all boxplots and the outlier summary to Google Drive.

What we found?

- Most features appear to have a few extreme values visually (e.g., Time_spent_Alone), but the majority of data falls within a reasonable range.
- According to the z-score method, there are no statistical outliers (z > 3) in any numeric feature. All features have 0 outliers detected.

The results summarized:

| Feature                 | Num Outliers | Percent Outliers |
|-------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| id                      | 0            | 0.0%             |
| Time_spent_Alone        | 0            | 0.0%             |
| Social_event_attendance | 0            | 0.0%             |
| Going_outside           | 0            | 0.0%             |
| Friends_circle_size     | 0            | 0.0%             |
| Post_frequency          | 0            | 0.0%             |

Interpretation:

- The dataset is very clean in terms of statistical outliers (z-score > 3), which means no extreme values are likely to distort your analysis or model training.
- Some features (like Time_spent_Alone) show a few visually extreme values in boxplots, but these are not statistically significant outliers.
- No special outlier handling is required at this stage, and you can proceed confidently to data cleaning and preprocessing. 

Step 4: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

What we did?

- Handled missing values in both train and test datasets: imputed numeric features with the median and categorical features with the most frequent value (fit on train, applied to both).
- Encoded categorical variables: mapped 'Personality' to binary (Extrovert=1, Introvert=0) in train, and used LabelEncoder for other categorical features (fit on train, applied to both).
- Saved the cleaned training data as train_cleaned.csv and the cleaned test data as test_cleaned.csv in the data folder in Google Drive.

What we found?

- All missing values in both train and test datasets were successfully imputed.
- All categorical variables were encoded numerically, ensuring compatibility with machine learning models.

Step 5: Normalization and Class Imbalance Handling

What we did?

- Standardized all numeric features in both the training and test datasets using StandardScaler.
- Addressed class imbalance in the training data using SMOTE to create a balanced dataset.
- Saved the final processed training data as train_final.csv and the final processed test data as test_final.csv in the data folder in Google Drive.

What we found?

- All numeric features now have zero mean and unit variance, ensuring comparability and improving model performance for algorithms sensitive to feature scale.
- The training dataset is now balanced, with equal numbers of extrovert and introvert samples.
- The final processed datasets are ready for feature engineering and model development.

The results summarized:

| Dataset      | Final Processed File Path                      |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Train        | /content/drive/MyDrive/Extro_Intro/data/train_final.csv |
| Test         | /content/drive/MyDrive/Extro_Intro/data/test_final.csv  |

Interpretation:

- Standardization ensures that all numeric features contribute equally to model training, preventing bias due to differing scales.
- Balancing the classes in the training data helps prevent model bias toward the majority class and supports fair evaluation.
- The data is now in optimal form for the next steps in the machine learning workflow. 

Step 6: Feature Engineering

What we did?

- Performed feature engineering on both the balanced, standardized training data (after SMOTE) and the standardized test data.
- Added new composite features to both train and test sets, including:
    - social_activity_score: sum of social activity features
    - introversion_score: sum of introversion-related features
    - alone_x_event: interaction between time spent alone and social event attendance
    - friends_per_post: ratio of friends circle size to post frequency
    - socializing_score: (Social_event_attendance + Going_outside + Friends_circle_size + Post_frequency) − (Time_spent_Alone + Drained_after_socializing)
- Saved the engineered datasets as train_engineered.csv and test_engineered.csv in the data folder in Google Drive.
- Visualized the distributions and class-wise boxplots of the new features to assess their separation power and distribution.

What we found?

- The new features, especially socializing_score and social_activity_score, show clear separation between introverts and extroverts in boxplots.
- The distributions of these features are often bimodal, reflecting the two personality classes.
- Visualizations confirm that the engineered features are informative and likely to improve model performance.

The results summarized:

| Feature Name         | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| introversion_score    | Sum of Time_spent_Alone and Drained_after_socializing                      |
| alone_x_event         | Time_spent_Alone × Social_event_attendance                                 |
| friends_per_post      | Friends_circle_size / (Post_frequency + 1)                                 |
| socializing_score     | (Social_event_attendance + Going_outside + Friends_circle_size + Post_frequency) − (Time_spent_Alone + Drained_after_socializing) |

Interpretation:

- Feature engineering after SMOTE (on train only) and standardization ensures that new features are available for both model training and evaluation.
- The new composite features provide interpretable, holistic measures of social and introverted behaviors, and their visual separation by class suggests strong predictive value.
- The engineered datasets are now ready for model selection and baseline training. 

Step 7: Feature Selection

What we did?

What we found?

- The most important features for predicting introvert vs. extrovert are the engineered composite features: social_activity_score, socializing_score, and introversion_score.
- Other important features include Time_spent_Alone, Stage_fear, and Social_event_attendance.
- Original features like Friends_circle_size and friends_per_post have lower importance.
- The feature importance plot clearly shows the value of feature engineering in improving model interpretability and performance.
